# Nodemailer-SMTP
This little program is designed to send an email using a Nodemailer library. Here's what it does in plain English:

Gathers Information:

It collects details like the sender's email address (dashipsita60@gmail.com in this case), the recipient's email address (dashsouradeep@gmail.com), the email subject ("Welcome to NodeJS App"), and a message ("This is an email using nodemailer in nodejs").
Prepares the Email:

It creates a fancy email with an image (pulled from a web address) in the body.

Sends the Email:

It uses your Gmail account (assuming you provided the correct password, which should not be stored in the code for security reasons) to send the email.
Provides Feedback:

If everything goes well, it prints a message saying "Email sent successfully."
If there's a problem, it prints an error message to help you debug the issue.
In a nutshell, this program automates sending an email with an attachment and some visual content using your Gmail account.
USE CASE:
